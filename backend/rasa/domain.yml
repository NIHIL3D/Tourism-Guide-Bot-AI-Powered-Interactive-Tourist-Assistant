For taxis, petit taxis (small, red) are ideal for short city trips, while grand taxis (larger, white) handle longer distances and shared rides. Ride-hailing services like inDrive and Yango are available but may vary in availability. The city's major train stations, Casa-Voyageurs and Casa-Port, connect to other cities, including via high-speed trains. Car rentals are widely available, and cycling and electric scooters are gaining popularity. Pedestrian-friendly areas such as the Corniche and Old Medina are great for walking. For airport transfers, Mohammed V International Airport is accessible by train, bus, taxi, or private shuttles."

In contrast, Maarif emerges as a bustling retail hub renowned for its diverse array of fashion boutiques, artisanal stores, and practical supermarkets, making it a convenient shopping destination catering to all tastes and needs in the city."

Portuguese and Spanish influence shaped the city's early development, but it was under French control in the 20th century that Casablanca flourished as a major port and economic center. Since Morocco's independence in 1956, Casablanca has continued to grow, becoming a modern metropolis while retaining its cultural heritage. Today, it stands as Morocco's largest city and a symbol of resilience and progress."
